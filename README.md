# Event Detection from Tweets
Detecting events as soon as they occur by applying Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing on Twitter data.

<br>Some part of my work is referred from the following research paper: 
<br>Li, C., Sun, A., Datta, A.: Twevent: segment-based event detection from tweets. Proceedings of the 21st ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (2012). http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2396785

The Process of Event Detection is divided into 3 main steps:
1. Tweet Segmentation
2. Bursty Segment Extraction
3. Event Segment Clustering
